  ### Project Overview
<img width="1325" height="702" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b178543f-fa7a-4253-baeb-29fee5b76d26" />

  In a world where access to clean water is a fundamental necessity, the region of Maji Ndogo faces significant challenges in ensuring this basic right for its residents. My project embarked on a critical mission to analyze water quality, collection patterns, and infrastructure in Maji Ndogo, with the goal of uncovering insights that could drive transformative change. This comprehensive report delves into the key findings and implications of the analysis, with a focus on improving water access and quality for the community.

The project aimed to:
- Investigate patterns of water collection and queue times.
- Identify discrepancies in water quality classifications.
- Analyze infrastructure and its impact on water accessibility.
- Propose actionable solutions to improve water access and quality.

  ### Data Source

- **Local Water Authority Records**: Provided historical data on water quality and infrastructure.
- **Community Surveys**: Collected information on water collection habits, queue times, and perceptions of water quality.
- **Field Inspections**: Gathered observational data on water sources and infrastructure conditions.

### Tools

- SQL - Data Cleaning & Data Analysis
-  Power BI - Data Analysis & Creating Reports

### Data Cleaning

### Data Analysis

The project employed a combination of analytical techniques:
- **Clustering**: Used to identify patterns in queue times and water source usage.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Applied to study variations in queue times across different days and times.
- **Quality Assessment**: Techniques were used to evaluate and rectify misclassifications in water quality data.

### Findings

- **Disparities in Water Access**: Significant differences in water access were found, with shared taps being a primary source for many, but leading to long queues.
- **Broken Infrastructure**: A substantial portion of the population faced issues with non-functional home infrastructure.
- **Contaminated Wells**: Identified instances of contamination in wells labeled as clean, necessitating corrective measures.

### Recommendations

- **Expanding Data Sources**: Incorporating additional data sources, such as satellite imagery, for more comprehensive analysis.
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Conducting long-term studies to assess the impact of implemented changes and refine strategies based on evolving data.
- **Community Engagement**: Engaging with the community to gather feedback and ensure that solutions are tailored to their needs and preferences.
